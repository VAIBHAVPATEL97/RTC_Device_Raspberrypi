# RTC_Device_Raspberrypi
In order to fulfill the need of a portable, low cost & compact embedded device to carryout real time voice, video & text transmission over a wireless medium, an RTC(Real Time Communication) module is proposed. This module consisting of the use of a raspberry pi is capable of being used as a notification device in any organization like a school, college or even in an office. The module is made to carryout real time voice, video & text communication over wireless LAN infrastructure. The use of Raspberry pi 3 is made as it is cheaper in cost, has more functions, portable & has availability of many open source software compared to any other embedded device currently available in the market. Transmission of text, audio & video has been carried out with the help of IRC, VoIP, SIP protocol & python programming  from one Raspberry pi3 module to another Raspberry pi3 module over wireless LAN infrastructure.
Network chat and Instant Messaging have seen an enormous rise in popularity over the last several years. IRC (Internet Relay Chat) provides  a way of communicating in real time with people from all over the world. It consists of various separate networks (or “nets”) of IRC servers, machines that allow users to connect to IRC. Raspberry PI can be made to obtain input from user through internet/private  network and takes appropriate action. It can be used as a portable computer. Hence,  a Real Time Communication Device.
